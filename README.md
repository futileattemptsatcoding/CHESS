### How to use it:

#### Check whether java is installed or not

#### Compile both files:
run this command in your terminal (make sure you are in the correct folder)
```java
javac -sourcepath GameManager:gui *.java;
```

#### Run main file:
```java
java gui
```

### Further optimizations/additions (yet to be done):
- [ ] Checking only the directions necessary for check after a piece movement
- [ ] Making a function for checking for checkmate so that the game can end more logically.
- [ ] Finding and correcting potential glitches and flaws

In case a user of this code finds a glitch/error/flaw/potential scope for bettering the code, I'd be glad if you let me know :)
